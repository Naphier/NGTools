Unity Editor Extensions and Tools by Napland Games  
  
Each tool is in it's own directory under _Scripts unless the tool is only one class file and doesn't rely on any others.  
  
The Custom Transform Component can be found as a standalone release in the tags section.  
  
Releases of tools that rely on multiple classes can be found in the tags section as they are completed so that they can be downloaded as standalone components. If you want everything you can always look at the master branch for the most recent full stable release.
